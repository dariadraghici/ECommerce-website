# ART-ISAN: Online Art Gallery

**Short Description:**

> A comprehensive web platform designed to showcase and sell unique artworks, featuring a custom PHP backend and integrated MySQL database management.


## 🎨 Project Overview

**ART-ISAN** is the culmination of my 12th-grade professional certification (Atestat). This project was born out of a passion for both art and technology, aiming to bridge the gap between young, emerging artists and art enthusiasts.

The platform serves as a fully functional e-commerce environment where users can browse galleries, learn about the history of specific pieces, manage a shopping cart, and interact with the creators.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dynamic Art Gallery:** A rich visual display of artworks (Paintings, Photography, and more) with detailed descriptions and pricing.
* **User Authentication:** A robust login and registration system to manage user sessions and secure personal data.
* **Persistent Database:** Powered by **XAMPP (MySQL)**, the system securely stores:
* User profiles and encrypted credentials.
* Customer reviews and feedback.
* Contact messages and inquiries.
* **Interactive Shopping Cart:** Real-time calculation of totals, taxes, and discounts based on the user's selection.
* **Responsive UI:** Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience from desktop to mobile devices.
* **Contact & Feedback:** An integrated form for users to send messages directly to the administration.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom styles and Font-Awesome icons), and JavaScript (for dynamic image switching and cart logic).
* **Backend:** PHP (Server-side logic and database connectivity).
* **Database:** MySQL (Managed via XAMPP/phpMyAdmin).
* **Design:** Modern, minimalist aesthetic focused on high-quality art presentation.

## 📁 Project Structure

The site is organized into multiple specialized pages to ensure a clean user journey:

* `index.html`: The gateway to the gallery, featuring the latest collections.
* `about.html`: Information regarding our mission and shipping/return policies.
* `cart.html`: The shopping management interface.
* `contact.html`: A dedicated portal for user inquiries.
* **Specific Artwork Pages:** (e.g., `ethereal.html`, `charleston.html`, `colivie.html`) Detailed views of individual masterpieces.
* `connect.php`: The bridge between the web interface and the SQL database.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Server Environment:** Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or any WAMP/LAMP stack.
2. **Database Configuration:**
* Open `phpMyAdmin`.
* Create a database named `login`.
* Import the SQL tables (for users and messages) as defined in the `connect.php` parameters.


3. **Deployment:** Place the project folder in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
4. **Launch:** Navigate to `http://localhost/ART-ISAN/index.html` in your browser.
